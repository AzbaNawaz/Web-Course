	<h2> <font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="white">Jal - The Band</font> </h2>
	<p> <font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="white">The name ‘JAL’ is the product of the band’s vision to recognize music as the artistic extension of this natural unity. Water is truly one of the most sacred parts of our existence and the band’s music celebrates that concept by orchestrating a symphony of lyrics and music that is as limitless and timeless as itself. The result was JAL-the band. The oft-quoted statement that ‘Music is the universal language of mankind’ hold particularly true when it comes to JAL’s music. Their music like itself knows no exceptions and boundaries. It aims to cater to people from all spheres of life and all ages.
